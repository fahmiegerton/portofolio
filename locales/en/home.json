    "full": "Hey there! I’m Arif Fahmi, a full-stack developer who loves turning complex problems into elegant solutions. Whether it’s building robust backends with Laravel and FilamentPHP or creating sleek, user-friendly interfaces with Vue.js and Inertia.js, I thrive on making the web a better place, one line of code at a time. When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or debugging my way through life’s little challenges. My GitHub is a testament to my passion for clean code (and my ongoing quest to make it more efficient), and my LinkedIn showcases my journey through the ever-evolving world of web development. Ready to dive into my world of code, creativity, and a sprinkle of humor? Let’s build something amazing together!",
